If you used to use --config=ironsettings.properties, use that file as your import, make sure the profile is named correctly with the rename profile button (as seen in second screen shot)

If you used to use an email (or more) to sync settings, the settings for each gmail account will be found in `profiles\gmailused` and you will need to import each one from each email.

If you want to load the client to a specific profile use `--profile=iron` like below
